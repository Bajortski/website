        So, I *really* like Elite Dangerous. This is one of the only MMORPGs that has made me say, "Spaceships and socializing are fun!" Joining a clan, and making friends is one of the best experiences I've had in a while (This happens in many MMORPGs, in fact, its one of the most common and enjoyable experiences that MMORPGs have to offer). I think that Elite Dangerous is very unique in the MMO space, because its game mechanics are very solid feel realistic, and I've even been considering buying a set of piloting controls, because I think that this experience is so solid. One major gripe I have is that Elite Dangerous doesn't allow for you to host your own private online multiplayer server, thus extending the lifetime of the game, (I am aware that this is almost never a feature that MMORPGs or RPGs in general implement, but this would be awesome) an issue that's immediately obvious is that this game is geared as a live-service game, where content is created and packaged for seasonal updates, I have a few solutions in mind for this: <br>
        One solution is to have a community editor/level editor, to allow for community content and mods, allowing for server hosts and even the Devs themselves to have a plethora of content to add to the game. Another option is to have some form of end to the live-service model, creating a procedural mission system, a base building system, terraforming, a deeper starting experience (on foot jobs and gameplay), scheduled jobs and work, a leaderboard (such as money, playtime, enemies killed etc.), and other systems that allow for players to play for longer before the content runs out. A final option would be a combination of the two, a system where server owners can create extensions of the game effectively allowing the game to have endless configurability and content. All in all, I think Elite Dangerous would be a perfect MMORPG to create a server system for a longer lifetime. Some potential difficulties with this plan are that, (as previously mentioned) Elite Dangerous is based on 'endless content served on a scheduled time scheme' which would make server hosting more of a glorified access point instead of a way of keeping the game playable in the case of a bankruptcy/discontinuation. Things like this require moderation, even in the case of small private servers, there could be a point where malware and exploitation becomes a major problem in this theoretical server ecosystem.

        Beat saber has to be one of the most panfiul rhythm games in existence...

        I'm not certain why beat saber makes me feel really good whilst also feeling absolutely terrible.<br>
        When I play, I play for around 1 - 3 hours. I'm not very good at the game currently, but I enjoy it a lot. I also often play ranked maps as they seem more polished than unranked maps.<br>

        I spend too much time watching anime and criticizing mark zuckerberg.<br>
        I find the stupid way this idiotic man attempts to market 'the future of socializing!' to be irritating and unnappealing. He doesn't do a good job at marketing this towards consumers who might be interested: Gamers<br>
        Allow me to elaborate:<br>
        - All of the current uses are "productivity" related (although... nothing says productivity like souless plasticine.) <br>
        - This 'metaverse' is less open and accessible than VRchat<br>
        - There is no reason to use Meta's 'solutions to problems that don't really exist when the current software functions perfectly fine.<br>

        To be completely honest, this 'metaverse' should have been developed as a compatibility API or the like, to make this a broader development than just budget VRchat. On a related note, if you plan on starting your grand 'Metaverse' by making a social platform attempting to compete with the likes of VRchat and RecRoom, the best you could do is allow the user to create their own avatar using external programs, even if it were curated ones, I'd be fine with at least more options than CORPORATE PLASTICINE!

        I just listened to the Stray OST, and honestly its the best part of the game, forget the epic visuals, intriguing story, just the music deserves so many awards.
