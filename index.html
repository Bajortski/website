        Beat saber has to be one of the most panfiul rhythm games in existence...

        I'm not certain why beat saber makes me feel really good whilst also feeling absolutely terrible.<br>
        When I play, I play for around 1 - 3 hours. I'm not very good at the game currently, but I enjoy it a lot. I also often play ranked maps as they seem more polished than unranked maps.<br>

        I spend too much time watching anime and criticizing mark zuckerberg.<br>
        I find the stupid way this idiotic man attempts to market 'the future of socializing!' to be irritating and unnappealing. He doesn't do a good job at marketing this towards consumers who might be interested: Gamers<br>
        Allow me to elaborate:<br>
        - All of the current uses are "productivity" related (although... nothing says productivity like souless plasticine.) <br>
        - This 'metaverse' is less open and accessible than VRchat<br>
        - There is no reason to use Meta's 'solutions to problems that don't really exist when the current software functions perfectly fine.<br>

        To be completely honest, this 'metaverse' should have been developed as a compatibility API or the like, to make this a broader development than just budget VRchat. On a related note, if you plan on starting your grand 'Metaverse' by making a social platform attempting to compete with the likes of VRchat and RecRoom, the best you could do is allow the user to create their own avatar using external programs, even if it were curated ones, I'd be fine with at least more options than CORPORATE PLASTICINE!

        I just listened to the Stray OST, and honestly its the best part of the game, forget the epic visuals, intriguing story, just the music deserves so many awards.
