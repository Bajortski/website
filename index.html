        I hope I haven't discussed my tases in music before, otherwise this entry will be redundant. I am a primarily EDM focused listener, I enjoy synthesised music because it can emulate any tone you throw at it. My favorite sub-genre of EDM is Hardcore / Hardstyle, which is a high BPM, with massive bass kicks. Outside of EDM, I really enjoy Ska, which is composed of upbeat trombone, saxophone, trombone and guitar, my favorite Ska band is Five Iron Frenzy. I recently got into listening to Math Rock, which is rock, but using more complicated time signatures to create a unique style. To be completely honest, I enjoy a lot of genres, and I have very few that I dislike.

        So, I recently 'discovered' a game called 'Dwarf Fortress', a game where you have dwarves, building fortresses. I saw a video about this game, positively gushing about how in-depth this ASCII-text game goes into the inner workings of a fictional dwarven society. It has been a dream of mine to start a game studio that attempts to construct a similar experience on a much larger scale: An MMO with a real time simulation taking the place of NPC's, and actual work taking the place of Quests. I fear if no-one will attempt such a feat, the gaming scene as we know it may not progress past the current era of AAA games (Forrmuleic nonsense where a handful of studios truly innovative games), and be stuck in a landfill of overly iterative games that only take a small crawl forward to appease the gAmErS. My cynicism broke out for a moment... Anyway, Dwarf Fortrress is an amazing experience, its $30 on steam, buy it.

        Kevin, don't read this one to me.<br>
        I had a conversation with Kevin that led me to this topic today...<br>
        Its almost as if I have spent the past couple months in a daze, my interactions with people honestly feel like I'm in the Truman Show, and I'm Truman. My interactions with people are the only thing that have any meaningful substance, I can't accomplish anything when I'm not talking to somebody. And I hate the fact that my humour seems to genuinely stem from the concept of "class clown" in one specific class, in all of the other classes, I act like a total socially averse person, mostly becasue I have my Steam Deck out and nobody stops me. This often causes my mind to only be occupied when I think there is nothing going on, or I feel that I can get by without paying attention. This apathy has led me to have a major issue with my grades, and since in two weeks, it will be the final quarter of my second last school week, its important that I get my act together. It's gotten so bad that I often end up playing games even when I *should* be paying attention, I often lose track of assignments, and I'm really concerned, but my concern appears to be nocturnal, which makes it impossible to get back on track. I don't know what to do Kevin, and I honestly don't care; I *wish* I could care, but I just can't! My grades don't matter to me, and my thoughts when I'm around my friends used to be "I love having laughing and having fun" are slowly creeping back into the section of "I do it becasue if I don't I'll fucking die inside". I wish I was an introvert, I wish I could be motivated, I wish I could get up off my butt and do something.<br>


Fuck.

        Hey.<br>
        So, I've been contemplating my future and whether or not I actually want to go through with quite a few things. My future seems to lead to being in an office chair doing either things I need to do in order to survive, or doing stuff I desperatly would love to do. In general, I've been contemplating whether or not I could 'Make it big' the Youtube space. Inconclusively enough, I honestly don't know. I've been attempting to make new stuff that feels fresh and lives up to the standards I have put in place for myself without killing myself in the process of recording voice over. I really hope I don't end up living in my parents 'basement' for the rest of my life trying to find work and a foothold in the Youtube world. I really enjoy making videos and putting them out there, but I don't know whether or not I have the creative drive to turn it into a career. Have a great weekend.

        And today on Rants Nobody Asked For... We have: TikTok Will Die!<br>
I write these off grid, so any inaccuracies can be blamed on the lack of research done before writing this.<br>
While Vine was technically a failure, it wasn't a failure due to lack of users, it was a failure due to the lack of monetization in the application itself (from what I gather, there was nome); But TikTok has (a still really bad monetizaton system, but at least it has one) had an astronomical user count, but has also garnered attention from many governments, as TikTok is an application run by ByteDance, a Chinese company, It has also been accused of performing 'surveillance' on users. Which leads me to a point I would like to make about social media in general: You consent to give up so much information by 'reading the EULA'. While eventually, when I get older and value my privacy more, I'll probably change my point of view on this, currently, my opinion on the usage of data collection goes as follows: If an application is only tracking my behaviour within the application that I am being advertised to in, in exchange for 'free' use of a (social) media platform, I view that trade as a valid and fair one. <br>
Notice, I said data collection *within* the application I'm using, the reason I made that distinction, is often when there is some form of login integration, you recieve some form of cookie (or send a packet to Google/Facebook advertising) that says, "Hey Google/Facebook! [User] uses this website!" I do not support this form of data collection, I am not on your site, you don't get to take information simply because I'm using your login integration (Google ads, specifically ads inside of websites are a bit of a weird exception, but also... I use an ad-blocker; This point is mostly directed at Facebook, who only have 4 properties where they *could* collect data from [Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the Oculus/Meta Quest], one of which shouldn't [and hopefully doesn't] have any form of data collection. Anyway, to make a long story short, Facebook doesn't [to my knowledge] have an embedded advertizing feature for third party hosts therefore, I shouldn't give up any data points when I'm not being advertized to). <br>
BUT I DIGRESS (I should have made that into a seperate entry, as thats much more interesting than what I'm going to talk about now), what many major political power players think is going on inside TikTok is a mass espionage attempt to somehow, gather important information from people from around the world. And I'm inclined to agree with them, if it weren't for the fact the reason for all of those data point collections are a sign of a well-designed social media platform. The thing that distincts TikTok from its relatives, is it (from what I gather,) collects much more data than all other media platforms in general. The data points, and the amount of them is what scares me, there is most definetly a reason for all of them: an insanely complex algorithm (or the Chinese government attempting to spy on the whole world simultaneously). The issue I have with this, is that even if the end user *does* agree to be surveiled so much, it can't be legal (I am not a lawyer, and I am off-grid), but whether or not it is, has honestly scared me away from using the site for posting videos. Anyway, its getting late and I don't have anywhere else to go with this rant in the middle of the night, goodbye Kevin.<br>

        I've made a point in the past when writing here to not neuter my true feelings by changing my language to fit whatever persona or tone I want to fit in at that time, (especially since pretty much nobody reads this) and I'm not going to start now. I've considered not updating this site because it's the subject of conversation among my peers when I'm present, but I've realized that it's very important to me and to other people to have something to talk about even if its embarrasing hearing the way I write when I feel like nobody's watching. In a way, this 'journal' is an open letter to KEVIN (Hi Kevin), who I felt comfortable discussing stuff like this with anyway, of course *now* its going to feel a lot more meta than it needs to be, because I felt the need to address to myself the fact that my tone and writing style in the past are perfectly fine. I also want to commit to this 'journal' for experiemental reasons: I want to see how my mannerisms and general writing style evole over time (I also want it to be an open book because while blogging is a dying medium, I hope to keep it alive in any way I possibly can). 
(I hope Kevin reads this part out loud to me) Kevin, thanks for reading this out loud to me in a public setting so I can constantly reconsider my choices when sitting down at my keyboard and writing a paragraph on whatever I feel like every couple of days.\

        ***THAR BE MOB PSYCHO SEASON III SPOILERS AHEAD***<br>
So, I just finished watching Mob Psycho 100 Season III and I have a couple of thoughts: (1) This season wasn't as packed with plot as the previous seasons, but I think that's okay, as this season was more focused on a two plots spanning (sort of) over 11 episodes, the Psycho Helmet plot, and the Mob Psycho plot, which took place over less time in terms of calendar days in universe, yet takes up so much time in terms of episode amount. The former observation is (I believe) one of the major problems with the episodic experience we call Anime, this is usually only a problem with "season based" shows, and One Piece, which is instead divided by what the community calls 'Arcs". And speaking of One Piece, a major issue I have with the show and what ultimately caused me to stop watching the show in need of a break, was the incredibly slow pacing, I would watch three episodes and we would still be either fighting the same battle, or on the same quest. The amount of time I've spent sitting at my monitor could have been greatly reduced if the plot wasn't slower than a sloth running a marathon. I digress, Mob Psycho doesn't have as much of a pacing issue, but during the last three or for episodes, the plot of "Mob walks slowly and dramatically towards Tsubomi while subjectively boring battles happen just doesn't really appeal to me, I was more on the edge of my seat because I was itching for Mob to get on with whatever his end goal was (I did really like the internal dialogue Mob has with himself). In spite of all of this, did I understand why this was done? Yes, the slow moving plot makes the tension all the more real, and this is quite honestly one of the more densely packed 'single plot marathons' as I am now dubbing this concept. I would have liked the finale a little more if it weren't for the fact that after all that, Mob doesn't get the girl and live happily ever after. In fact, when he got rejected I considered the possibility of an additional season, but the specific way the final episode ends tells me that I'm not going to see any more Mob, The reason I came to this conclusion is due to  a trope in the film industry where all of the major protagonists (and occasionally some minor ones) get together and celebrate something, or just get together, signaling to the viewer that this is the conclusion of the adventure (An example of this trope off the top of my head is Nichijou). To be clear, I liked season III, I just have major issues with Single Plot Marathons as a whole. Also, hi Kevin :)

        So, I'm in the process of reading the manga / webcomic series by Fred Gallagher called MegaTokyo (which you can find at megatokyo.com), and something interesting I found that I wanted to comment on is the argument that (contrary to popular opinion) sci-fi is fantasy (Rant on August 23rd, 2000 for those interested), and I personally agree with the semantic argument brought up here, Fantasy (essentially) means fiction, and therefore it is not limited by the time period in which it is "taking place" in. The thing I disagree with, is the implied notion that there is no merit in treating Fantasy and Sci-Fi as separate genres, similar to grammar, and other systems created for ease of understanding, semantics is a system allowing for words to mean something, and while it is true that often the consensus on whether or not a word is being used properly is most often not up for debate, it definitely should be. But I digress, (I wouldn't want to go on a tangent about the freedoms language offers us that has essentially been ripped from our hands via education, that's a complaint for another day) Fantasy and sci-fi have been defined as separate genres when being inside the niches of fictional literature and Video Games, while technically being the same semantically, the communities surrounding fantasy and sci-fi have decided to make the two genres into separate ones that are "similar only in that they are fiction". This change, I would argue is for the better, as this removes much confusion in discussion and makes discussions on the topic of Fantasy much easier to go through with more jargon-acquainted parties. A solution that could have been implemented when the respective Fantasy and Sci-fi communities were a bit smaller would have been to implement a different title for Fantasy, something along the lines of Valour, or Oldies, or Past-fi. All of this to say, I agree with everything mister Gallagher said in regards to treating final fantasy VIII as a fantasy game, because indeed, it is in our imagination, just that I wouldn't name my franchise final fantasy if it was futuristic (I'm aware this isn't the norm for FF games, but screw you, I say what I like, and I'm not hitting backspace just for you). In any case, nobody but a few people really care about the distinction between the two very different genres that have been around longer than anyone currently on the planet today.<br>

COMPLETELY UNRELATED PARAGRAPH:
Contractions should not be discouraged or banned,as language is fluid, and designed for convenience, I should be able to use a shortened version of "is not" if I want to, without being immediately disregarded by 'real intellectuals' I like to think of myself as being capable of deserving such a title, but I don't believe that refraining from using contractions should be discouraged, or punished in the educational system. <br>

RELATED TO THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE IN THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT 'INTELLECTUALS' BUT THIS TIME IN A LESS CRITICAL LIGHT:
While I understand not understanding scientific or 'intellectual' papers and their jargon and 'Big Words', I wouldn't say that such language is being used conciously, and if it is, its not being used to make non-'intellectuals' feel inferior. I feel such language is used to add concision and clarity in a setting where such writing is rewarded and encouraged while not always being necessary.</p>

        I'd like to build an open world game similar to Forza Horizon at its base, but there are also other expansions that add whole new game modes (like, the genre changes) but its in the same areas so there's a sort of seamlessness and polish you feel in a game designed for the individual games. *and* its (optionally) an MMO, so you can see other players while you're doing whatever you're doing.<br>
In order to foster this kind of experience you would need a single continuous instance (or multiple different areas seperated by arbitrary borders) where nothing is changed and nothing you do can cause a random area to appear (this means there would need to be some sort of racetrack system, and you can only really go on the track when you're supposed to, (but it would also be very interesting if you could 'interact' with people on the racetrack) and you can see other players *not* in the race. It would be super cool if you could base stuff thats in the air on real weather and air traffic data (*or* some sort of VATsim integration). (This would also require some sort of real-life location to base the areas off of)

        I have so many big plans that I could enact based on the idea of cinematography or "content creation", I really like the idea of making a show based around this 'alter-ego' I call Toast. I'd also like to start a band called "The Tractor Pulled Disc Ploughs" I have no clue what genre we would make, but I'd really enjoy having a musical outlet to put my feelings into (the basic idea would be a Mock-british band, the idea started as a joke, but it might prove to be a successful idea).<br>
On the subject of music, Beat Saber is back in my loop of things I do because I want to. I took a bit of a hiatus (meaning I really only played so I wouldn't get stale), and I'm back and ready to (hopefully) rise the ranks! Besides Beat Saber, I've been trying out Quaver (its just osu!mania but with stricter scoring) and I think I understand how beginner players feel when starting out in beat saber, not understanding how patterns translate to what movements, and the like. I guess the only reason this didn't happen to me as much when I started playing beat saber is that I watched TONS of Beat Saber Content, and to be completely honest, I had already gotten down the basics of the game without ever having put on the headset. I will say that I'm liking Quaver a lot more than I thought I would. Although, I don't think I'll be hooked to it the same way I am to Beat Saber.<br>

        I'm gonna spend a ton of time playing games this Christmas, I hope that I can find some content to make that isn't Beat Saber...<br>
        One of the most annoying parts of playing Beat Saber in a ranked setting is I need to play (and improve scores) almost every day to keep my rank going up, or even just breaking even and not moving down. (For context, I'm currently in the top 3,000 on BeatLeader... Not that that's impressive.) To be completely honest, I'm a bit tired of the game, I only really play ranked maps and I improve slower than... well, slower than I wish I could. <br>
        Another thing I'd like to complain about today is the fact that video games are too big (or the smallest storage spaces are to small). When you consider the fact that the (usual) smallest storage size on most portable devices are usually somewhere in the range of 64-128Gbs. Budget people (like me), don't get the pleasure (usually) having more than one AAA game on one storage device. On the current device that I use every day (My wonderful Steam Deck), I chose the smallest storage size because I thought I would get one more week of summer work to go towards a new hard drive.<br>
        Speaking of the Steam Deck... I got on this big game development kick for a while (that initial hype had died down well before I got me Steam Deck), and a couple months into my Deck experience I realized that I could attempt to make games using the Unity Game Engine. So I downloaded Unity, and after having multiple connection issues causing me to have to re-download the entire thing. When I managed to get the engine downloaded, I fired up a sample project, and whenever I opened one of several menus (It felt like pretty much every one), Unity would hang. I attempted to fix this problem by reinstalling Unity multiple times to no avail. Angered and tired of linux and Unity not wanting to have a nice meeting, I filed a support ticket which (thank goodness), led to me finding out that this is a known issue and is fixed in an alpha version. So I installed the alpha version and (after having a bunch of download issues), downloaded a basic Unity 3d template, and... realized I needed a controller so that I can control the camera. And thats where I am now, looking for an FPS controller so that I can make video games.<br>

        So, I *really* like Elite Dangerous. This is one of the only MMORPGs that has made me say, "Spaceships and socializing are fun!" Joining a clan, and making friends is one of the best experiences I've had in a while (This happens in many MMORPGs, in fact, its one of the most common and enjoyable experiences that MMORPGs have to offer). I think that Elite Dangerous is very unique in the MMO space, because its game mechanics are very solid feel realistic, and I've even been considering buying a set of piloting controls, because I think that this experience is so solid. One major gripe I have is that Elite Dangerous doesn't allow for you to host your own private online multiplayer server, thus extending the lifetime of the game, (I am aware that this is almost never a feature that MMORPGs or RPGs in general implement, but this would be awesome) an issue that's immediately obvious is that this game is geared as a live-service game, where content is created and packaged for seasonal updates, I have a few solutions in mind for this: <br>
        One solution is to have a community editor/level editor, to allow for community content and mods, allowing for server hosts and even the Devs themselves to have a plethora of content to add to the game. Another option is to have some form of end to the live-service model, creating a procedural mission system, a base building system, terraforming, a deeper starting experience (on foot jobs and gameplay), scheduled jobs and work, a leaderboard (such as money, playtime, enemies killed etc.), and other systems that allow for players to play for longer before the content runs out. A final option would be a combination of the two, a system where server owners can create extensions of the game effectively allowing the game to have endless configurability and content. All in all, I think Elite Dangerous would be a perfect MMORPG to create a server system for a longer lifetime. Some potential difficulties with this plan are that, (as previously mentioned) Elite Dangerous is based on 'endless content served on a scheduled time scheme' which would make server hosting more of a glorified access point instead of a way of keeping the game playable in the case of a bankruptcy/discontinuation. Things like this require moderation, even in the case of small private servers, there could be a point where malware and exploitation becomes a major problem in this theoretical server ecosystem.

        I'm not certain why beat saber makes me feel really good whilst also feeling absolutely terrible.<br>
        When I play, I play for around 1 - 3 hours. I'm not very good at the game currently, but I enjoy it a lot. I also often play ranked maps as they seem more polished than unranked maps.<br>

        I spend too much time watching anime and criticizing mark zuckerberg.<br>
        I find the stupid way this idiotic man attempts to market 'the future of socializing!' to be irritating and unnappealing. He doesn't do a good job at marketing this towards consumers who might be interested: Gamers<br>
        Allow me to elaborate:<br>
        - All of the current uses are "productivity" related (although... nothing says productivity like souless plasticine.) <br>
        - This 'metaverse' is less open and accessible than VRchat<br>
        - There is no reason to use Meta's 'solutions to problems that don't really exist when the current software functions perfectly fine.<br>

        To be completely honest, this 'metaverse' should have been developed as a compatibility API or the like, to make this a broader development than just budget VRchat. On a related note, if you plan on starting your grand 'Metaverse' by making a social platform attempting to compete with the likes of VRchat and RecRoom, the best you could do is allow the user to create their own avatar using external programs, even if it were curated ones, I'd be fine with at least more options than CORPORATE PLASTICINE!
